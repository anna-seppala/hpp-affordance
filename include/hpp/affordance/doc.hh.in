/// \section hpp_affordance_intro Introduction
///
/// This package implements a library that builds representations of a robot's
/// environment in terms of affordances, which describe surrounding objects
/// based on their application possibilities. For instance, large vertical
/// surfaces may be applied for leaning, whereas smaller horizontal surface
/// areas (e.g. stairs) allow for a robot to step on them.
///
/// hpp-affordance utilises triangulated meshes created from objects of type 
/// fcl::collisionObject as implemented in \htmlonly<a class="el" href="@HPP_FCL_DOXYGENDOCDIR@/index.html">hpp-fcl</a>\endhtmlonly. Please refer to its package documentation for details.
///
/// There are some helper classes within this package that help in the
/// affordance analysis. For example:
/// \li hpp::affordance::Affordance
/// \li hpp::affordance::SemanticsData
/// \li hpp::affordance::OperationBase
/// 
/// However, the main functionality is provided by free functions, such as
/// \li hpp::affordance::affordanceAnalysis
/// 
/// 
///
